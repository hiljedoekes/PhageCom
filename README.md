# PhageCom
Matlab and Mathematica codes belonging to the paper "Repeated outbreaks drive the evolution of bacteriophage communication" by H.M. Doekes, G.A. Mulder and R. Hermsen.

MATHEMATICA

Scripts used to support the analytical derivation of the evolutionarily stable strategy in the absence of arbitrium communication (phi_ESS.nb - also used for figure in Box 1) and in its presence (thres_ESS.nb).

MATLAB

Scripts for numerically solving the system of differential equations and generating figures in the absence of arbitrium communication (NoComm) and in its presence (Comm). See overview_scripts_and_data.pdf for code and data per figure.
